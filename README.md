# PyBer_Analysis


#Overview of the analysis:
The purpose of this new analysis was to summarize the ride-sharing data by city type, then we used this data to weekly faires bu city type for a 4 month period of time. 





#Results:
Using the summary dataframe we can see that Urban cities have the most rides and the most drivers, followed by suburban and rural respectively. This is generally what one would assume. 
The interesting part here though is that suburban drivers are making triple what urban drivers are making and suburban are making double. 
We can conclude from this data that rural riders are been driven farther than urban rides, but the number of rides for urban is not high enough for the number of drivers.
From the Total Fare by City Type graph, we can see that suburban cities are the most consistent with their fares per week while Urban varies the most from week to week.
Rural also has one week in january where they also made no fare money. 








#Summary: 
To maximize profit, you should reduce the number of urban drivers you hire since there are more drivers than rides. This will make the drivers you do have get paid more as well and increase employee satisfaction
Suburban travel is the most consistent throughout the weeks. It would be beneficial to keep the number of drivers where they are at near $40 per driver and try to get urban up to and rural down to about $40 to maximize efficentcy 
Since the rural riders travel a farther distance, it would be wise to hire more, but only in the rural cities that have the most rides. This could increase the popularity of Pyber in these cities as well.
